# JavaScript Assessment - practice
**Windows Users**: Please use one of our workstation machines for the assessments.

This assessment aims to evaluate your knowledge of JavaScript's basic
and intermediate features.

Topics covered:

  * Basic syntax: function declarations, objects, etc.
  * Closures, `this`, `apply`
  * Prototypal inheritance
  * Module pattern

You have 1 hour. The specs live in the `spec/` directory. Your code
should go in the `src/` directory in the files provided. All your
functions should be namespaced under `Assessment`.

How to run the specs: open up `SpecRunner.html` in a browser.

## Basic JavaScript

### `mergeSort`

### `recursiveExponent`

## Closures + `this`

### `myBind`

### `transpose`

## Prototypal Inheritance

### `inherits`

Write a function `inherits` that takes two constructor functions (child
and parent) and properly sets up the prototype chain. The function
should return the child constructor. Your function should not call the
parent's constructor function in setting up the prototype chain.
